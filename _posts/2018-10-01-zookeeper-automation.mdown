## Zookeeper Automation

This project automates the deployment and maintenance of Apache Zookeeper clusters by solving a fundamental distributed systems challenge: how to enable multiple machines to automatically generate unique IDs and discover each other without manual configuration.

## The Challenge

In distributed systems, when you have multiple machines (e.g., 5 Zookeeper nodes), each needs a unique identifier. While consensus algorithms like Raft can elect a leader to assign IDs, this approach adds unnecessary complexity for our use case.

## The Solution

I developed a simpler, more elegant approach: machines use a common rule based on their IP addresses to deterministically generate unique IDs. By sorting IP addresses and using the position in the sorted list as the ID, each machine can independently determine its identity without coordination.

## Background

Apache Zookeeper requires two critical configuration elements to start:
- `zoo.cfg`: Configuration file with cluster information
- `myid`: A unique identifier (1-5 for a 5-node cluster)

Previously, these were manually configured, which became problematic when:
- Deploying to new environments
- Replacing instances during maintenance
- Scaling clusters dynamically

This automation solution eliminates manual intervention and enables seamless cluster management.

## Requirements

The automation system addresses two key scenarios:

### 1. Initial Deployment
- Automatically generate `zoo.cfg` with all cluster members
- Assign unique `myid` to each Zookeeper instance
- Ensure consistent configuration across all nodes

### 2. Maintenance & Recovery
- Detect when a node is joining an existing cluster
- Preserve the original node's identity (same `myid`)
- Maintain cluster stability during replacements

The system determines whether a Zookeeper instance is joining a new cluster or replacing a node in an existing cluster, then generates appropriate configurations accordingly.

## Implementation Approaches

I explored and implemented three different solutions, each with unique advantages:

### 1. Elastic IP (EIP) Approach
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/zookeeper_automation/eip.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"></div>

- Uses AWS Elastic IPs as static identifiers
- Provides consistent external addressing
- Ideal for cross-region deployments

### 2. Elastic Network Interface (ENI) Approach
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/zookeeper_automation/eni.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"></div>

- Leverages secondary private IPs via ENI
- Better for internal cluster communication
- Reduces external IP costs

### 3. Dynamic Reconfiguration Approach
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/zookeeper_automation/private_ip.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"></div>

- Utilizes Zookeeper 3.5.0+ dynamic reconfiguration feature
- Allows runtime cluster membership changes
- Most flexible for dynamic environments

## Key Benefits

- **Zero Manual Configuration**: Fully automated deployment and maintenance
- **High Availability**: Seamless instance replacement without downtime
- **Scalability**: Easy cluster expansion and contraction
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces operational overhead and configuration errors
