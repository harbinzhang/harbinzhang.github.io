## Barcode Food App

A modern restaurant ordering system built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase, featuring a three-layer testing strategy, state machine-based authentication, and production-grade infrastructure that handles real-world restaurant operations at scale.

## The Challenge

Building a restaurant ordering system presents unique technical challenges:
- **Real-time Requirements**: Orders must flow instantly from customers to kitchen with zero data loss
- **Authentication Complexity**: Multi-role access control (owners, managers, staff) with store-level permissions
- **Testing at Scale**: Ensuring reliability across unit, integration, and E2E tests in a distributed system
- **Offline Resilience**: Restaurants can't stop taking orders when internet is spotty
- **State Management**: Complex authentication states that must be predictable and debuggable

Traditional approaches often result in flaky authentication, poor test coverage, and systems that break under real-world conditions. I needed to build something production-ready from day one.

## The Solution

I architected a comprehensive restaurant ordering platform with enterprise-grade reliability:
- **State Machine Authentication** ensuring predictable auth transitions
- **Three-Layer Testing Strategy** with Docker orchestration
- **Offline-First Architecture** with intelligent queueing
- **Monorepo Structure** for code sharing and consistency
- **Production Monitoring** with custom analytics and error tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Monorepo Organization

The project uses a monorepo structure for better code sharing and consistency:

```
barcode-food-app/
├── apps/
│   ├── seller/          # Restaurant management dashboard
│   │   ├── core/        # Core business logic
│   │   │   ├── auth/    # Authentication state machine
│   │   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── repositories/
│   │   └── functions/   # Cloud Functions
│   └── order/          # Customer ordering interface
├── shared/             # Shared utilities
│   └── utils/
│       ├── tokenCache.ts    # Cross-tab token sync
│       ├── networkState.ts  # Network management
│       └── rateLimiter.ts   # API throttling
└── tests/
    └── e2e/           # End-to-end tests
```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18.3, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Storage)
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Firebase Hosting
- **Monitoring**: Custom analytics with Firebase

## Three-Layer Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing with Docker

I implemented containerized unit testing for consistency across environments:

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  environment: 'jsdom',
  coverage: {
    thresholds: {
      lines: 80,
      branches: 70,
      functions: 70,
      statements: 80
    }
  }
})
```

**Docker Integration**:
```makefile
test:
	@if docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; then \
		docker-compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit unit-tests; \
	else \
		$(MAKE) test-local; \
	fi
```

Key features:
- Memory-constrained containers (1GB limit)
- Thread pool execution for performance
- Complete Firebase SDK mocking
- 80% coverage requirements

### 2. Integration Testing with Firebase Emulators

The integration layer uses Docker orchestration for Firebase emulator testing:

```yaml
services:
  emulators:
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Firestore
      - "9099:9099"  # Auth
      - "5001:5001"  # Functions
      - "9199:9199"  # Storage
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/"]
      interval: 3s
      retries: 60
  
  int-tests:
    depends_on:
      emulators:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      - FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=emulators:8080
      - FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST=emulators:9099
```

This ensures:
- Service isolation
- Automatic health checks
- Data seeding capabilities
- Reproducible test environments

### 3. E2E Testing with Retry Strategies

Playwright tests against staging with advanced retry mechanisms:

```typescript
// Smart retry helper for flaky tests
export async function retryClick(page, selector, options) {
  return retryOperation(async () => {
    try {
      // First try: normal click
      await element.click({ timeout: 2000 });
    } catch (error) {
      try {
        // Second try: force click
        await element.click({ force: true });
      } catch (forceError) {
        // Third try: JavaScript click
        await element.evaluate(el => el.click());
      }
    }
  }, options);
}

// Enhanced error capture
export class TestError extends Error {
  async captureContext(page) {
    this.context.screenshot = await page.screenshot();
    this.context.url = page.url();
    this.context.consoleLogs = await page.evaluate(/* ... */);
  }
}
```

## Authentication State Machine

### The Problem with Traditional Auth

Most React apps handle authentication with scattered boolean flags:
- `isLoading`, `isAuthenticated`, `isRefreshing`
- Leads to impossible states (loading AND authenticated?)
- Hard to debug state transitions
- Race conditions during token refresh

### State Machine Solution

I implemented a finite state machine for predictable authentication:

```typescript
enum AuthState {
  UNINITIALIZED,
  INITIALIZING,
  AUTHENTICATED,
  REFRESHING_TOKEN,
  TOKEN_EXPIRED,
  SIGNING_OUT,
  SIGNED_OUT,
  ERROR
}

class AuthStateMachine {
  private currentState: AuthState = AuthState.UNINITIALIZED;
  private stateHistory: Array<{state: AuthState; timestamp: number}> = [];
  
  transition(newState: AuthState): void {
    const validTransitions = STATE_TRANSITIONS[this.currentState];
    if (!validTransitions.includes(newState)) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid transition: ${this.currentState} -> ${newState}`);
    }
    
    this.currentState = newState;
    this.addToHistory(newState);
    this.notifyListeners(newState);
  }
  
  canPerformOperations(): boolean {
    return this.currentState === AuthState.AUTHENTICATED;
  }
}
```

### Token Management Strategy

The authentication system implements several advanced patterns:

#### Deduplication & Grace Period

Prevents token refresh storms:

```typescript
const refreshToken = async (force = false) => {
  // Return existing promise if refresh in progress
  if (refreshPromiseRef.current) {
    return refreshPromiseRef.current;
  }
  
  // Grace period check (5 seconds)
  if (!isUrgent && timeSinceLastRefresh < 5000) {
    return; // Skip refresh
  }
  
  // Perform refresh with circuit breaker
  refreshPromiseRef.current = performRefresh();
};
```

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Prevents cascade failures after repeated errors:

```typescript
if (consecutiveFailures >= 3) {
  // Circuit open - reject immediately
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Auto-recovery after 30 seconds
    circuitBreakerOpen = false;
  }, 30_000);
}
```

#### Offline Queue

Maintains operations when offline:

```typescript
if (!networkState.isOnline) {
  offlineQueue.add(async () => {
    await refreshToken(force);
  });
  return;
}
```

### AuthIntegration Bridge

Connects Firebase Auth with the state machine:

```typescript
export const AuthIntegration: React.FC = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = onIdTokenChanged(auth, async (user) => {
      if (user) {
        authStateMachine.transition(AuthState.INITIALIZING);
        const tokenResult = await user.getIdTokenResult();
        
        if (tokenResult.expirationTime > Date.now()) {
          authStateMachine.transition(AuthState.AUTHENTICATED);
        } else {
          authStateMachine.transition(AuthState.TOKEN_EXPIRED);
        }
      } else {
        authStateMachine.transition(AuthState.SIGNED_OUT);
      }
    });
    
    // Proactive token refresh
    const refreshInterval = setInterval(async () => {
      if (tokenExpiringIn < 5_MINUTES) {
        await refreshToken();
      }
    }, 60_000);
    
    return () => {
      unsubscribe();
      clearInterval(refreshInterval);
    };
  }, []);
  
  return null;
};
```

## Conclusion

Building a production-ready restaurant ordering system required more than just connecting React to Firebase. By implementing a state machine for authentication, Docker-based testing infrastructure, and comprehensive retry strategies, I created a system that's both reliable and maintainable.

The three-layer testing approach ensures quality at every level, while the authentication architecture provides the predictability needed for enterprise applications. This isn't just another CRUD app – it's a battle-tested platform ready for real-world restaurant operations.

The code demonstrates that with the right architecture patterns – state machines, circuit breakers, offline queues – you can build systems that are both complex and reliable. The key is choosing the right abstractions and testing them thoroughly.
