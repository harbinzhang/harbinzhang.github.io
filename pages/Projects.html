<h3>EECS482 (Operating Systems)</h3>
<ul align="left">
<li>Threads: Designed a concurrent Thread Library for multi-processor multi-threaded applications. CPUs sleep or wake up depending on the current thread's requests. Error handling, including resource exhaustion, is fully implemented.</li>
<li>Memory Manager: Implemented a pager that manages application processes' virtual address spaces, including swap blocks and file blocks. Features include zero-pin pages, copy-on-write, and various performance optimizations.</li>
<li>File Server: Developed a multi-threaded, secure network file server. Client processes interact with it via network messages to access and modify their data. Unauthorized access attempts are denied.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Web Service : EECS485 (Web Database)</h3>
Built a web server where users can view public and personal photo albums, and upload new photos. The system includes user authentication with sign-in and sign-up functionality.
<ul align="left">
<li>Utilized Flask for the web server backend, HTML with Jinja2 templating for dynamic web pages, JavaScript for client-side functionality, and AJAX with JSON for client-server data transfer.</li>
<li>Implemented session management to maintain user state, and SHA512 with salt hashing to defend against rainbow table attacks. Authorization for sensitive pages is managed through secure session validation.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Database : EECS484 (Database Management Systems)</h3>
Built a relational database for storing information about a "Fakebook" social network with appropriate constraints and relationships.
<ul align="left">
<li>Used JDBC to implement Fakebook Oracle, a program that executes complex queries against the Fakebook database.</li>
<li>Implemented a single-threaded version of the ARIES recovery algorithm for crash recovery.</li>
<li>Exported data from Oracle to MongoDB and wrote MongoDB queries for data manipulation and retrieval.</li>
</ul>


<h3>MapReduce Engine : EECS485 (Web Database)</h3>
<ul align="left">
<li>Implemented a Hadoop-like MapReduce framework with master and worker nodes for distributed processing of large datasets, including a distributed file system and fault tolerance mechanisms to handle datanode failures.</li>
</ul>



<h3>2-way R10K : 2-way Superscalar Out-of-Order Processor</h3>
In this project, I was responsible for the Reservation Station (RS), Common Data Bus (CDB), Fetch unit, I/D cache, and Branch Predictor.
<ul align="left">
<li>Data cache: Implemented a 2-way set-associative cache with LRU replacement policy (using reference and dirty bits) to optimize memory I/O usage through efficient block eviction.</li>
<li>Instruction cache: Implemented a direct-mapped cache, providing sufficient performance for instruction fetch requirements while maintaining implementation simplicity.</li>
<li>Prefetch: Implemented a priority-based prefetching mechanism (Dcache load, Icache load, Icache prefetch, Dcache store) to optimize memory I/O utilization and accelerate system performance.</li>
<li>Reservation Station: Designed separate reservation station blocks for different instruction types, enabling simultaneous issue of up to 6 instructions (2 ALU, 1 STORE, 1 LOAD, 1 MULT, 1 BRANCH), significantly improving potential system performance.</li>
</ul>
